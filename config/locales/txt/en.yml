    race: A few states ask for your race  or ethnic group, in order to administer the Federal Voting Rights Act.  Please make a choice that best describes you from the list below
    party: In some states, you must register with a party if you  want to  take part in that party’s primary election, caucus, or convention.  If you do not want to register with a party, select "none". Do not select "independent" if you  mean "no party," because this  might  be confused with the name of a political party in your state.
